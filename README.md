# Saga 2020
A game prototype, currently in the form of a Mega Man X fangame.

## Major changes to the Mega Man X formula
1. Full range of aim instead of only shooting forward.
1. projectiles collide with walls
1. Enemies respawn at logical locations. Not arbitrary static points.
1. no instant-death spikes or bottomless pits
1. Replace teleportation with airdrop from chopper
1. Arbitrary ground and wall angles
1. Avoid button-mashing with hold-to-fire. This is to save wear-and-tear on game controller triggers, and mouse buttons.
