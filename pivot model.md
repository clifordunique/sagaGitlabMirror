sandbox seems like full of possibility
But real life is dull / dangerous
experience of going to movie seems more important/relevant than the story within the movie.
Story OF the gameplay is important, the story IN the game is not.
example: sports, such as football.
---
1. mechanics: toy
2. add a goal: puzzle
3. acceptable failure.
  uncertainty
  prevents planning
player can distinguish between mechanics and acceptable failure
player will create contingency plans
player must feel it's 'fair': AI. Chance. Twitch skills. Complexity.
Complexity: physics. predictable, almost
---
Cheap satisfaction
Mechanics, Goal, Acceptable Failure
but what about the story shown during marketing?
Story-ettes 'nuggets'
4. Situational pivots
"Add Then"
football: start at 0-0. team scores! other team scores! etc
How you get there is important, not the end.

player aware of potential changes to situation; prepares contingencies.
multiple situations; one is more advantageous at any given time.
Sacrifice [abilities] to achieve desired situational state
Changing of the situation is something the player can affect.
Examples:
1. Monopoly: There's a Bull market and Bear market, and landing on properties might pay out to the player that lands on them. Then allow the players to somehow flip the market to their advantage. This changes the game story of the game from "Bill acquired properties and then got more later after making deals" to something much more dramatic.
2. Formula One racing: Rain changes advantages based on tire selection, or sacrificing time during a pit stop to change to more advantageous tires. If the rain could be turned on/off by the players multiple times during race, and especially if a sacrifice (of fuel or something) was required, it would create a much more dynamic and player-altered dramatic tension.
4. player needs: zombie game shifts from killing zombies to finding bandages to stop bleeding. A more interesting mechanic would be if the player WANTED to bleed because it became advantageous.
## More Examples:
Magic. pivot on the effectiveness of categories of magic.
Faction control. Unique consequences to different factions controlling the field.
Submarine warfare: slow and silent VS fast and loud. No purely-advantageous states, there is a tradeoff in each decision.
* Level change
* flooding the world
* mechanics change in light VS darkness
