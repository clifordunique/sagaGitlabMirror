1. Does the game launch successfully?
2. Did you use the itch.io app or download the app?
3. Is the framerate (in the upper righthand corner) typically above or below 50 fps?
4. Do you use keyboard or game controller?
5. Are the controls too difficult or uncomfortable to use?
6. Did you change the bindings?
7. What is your preferred Cursor Sensitivity?
8. Do you like Cursor Influence option?
9. What is your preferred Camera Size (Shown in lower lefthand corner. Use scroll wheel or settings menu to change)
10. Did you have difficulty aiming?
11. Any specific control layout preferences?
  * On gamepad, are bumpers okay for dash and jump?
