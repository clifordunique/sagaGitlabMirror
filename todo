- game feel: wall jump
  + walljump anim
  - camera horizontal range
  - double tap wall jump pushes away from wall
fix:
- projectiles get stuck on invulnerable player, characters
+ projectiles get stuck on shield
+ projectiles should never penetrate shield
- bottom of wall jump issue
- liftbot shake
