* need new repo on gitlab

- Design doc
- fix: enemy LOS raycast hits themselves

- spiderbot
spiderpawn has dynamic body
liftbot kinematic
remove trigger layer, add OnTriggerEnter, collider->trigger = true
removed layers: flameprojectile, enemy
- reclaim body


playercontroller record/input, moveup/movedown, add spider action map
- stickybomb exploding interaction with shield:
  1) do raycast to each IDamage within range
  2) if raycast hits something else, do a projection of the collider onto a perpendicular vector of the normal
  3) use the projected endpoints to do two more raycasts
  4) if the raycast hits an IDamage collider, proceed

  # big mech boss
  spline culling
  mech scaling when flip... looks bad. no flipping.
  "danger ball and chain" needs destruction anims; explosions, and particles?
