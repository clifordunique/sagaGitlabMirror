In my opinion, every game in the franchise suffers from the same problems: small viewing area, can only shoot forward, enemies respawn immediately out of sight, levels are static.

1. Camera view range.
Camera can center on an imaginary point around the player, in the aiming direction. Allow for variance in zoom, depending on how cozy the surroundings (raycast in a few directions to determine).

2. Full range of aim.
MegamanX can only shoot forwards, not upwards or even slightly higher. The ability to shoot upwards in games like Contra is an improvement. Having weapons that spread out when shot can make this limitation feel less awkward.

3. Enemies respawn at logical locations.
Not arbitrary static points.
